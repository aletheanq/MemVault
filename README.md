# MemVault: Eternal Memories with Cloud-Based Technologies and AI
MemVault is a device/application project that integrates AI and cloud-based technologies to assist people with dementia and other memory loss-related issues. It records audio, summarizes context offline, and sends audible notifications for the contexts being referred to by the user's daily life. 

## Problem 
Dementia is an umbrella term describing a group of symptoms affecting cognitive functions, causing interference with a person's daily life. Currently (as of December 17, 2025), over 55 million people experience dementia, and the number of people with dementia continues to grow because of higher aging populations, increasing awareness, and risk factors. It is caused because of changes in brain regions, impacting the performance of neurons and their connections. Memory-loss is a common symptom for people experiencing dementia [^1].

However, dementia is not the only cause of memory-loss. Memory-loss can occur because of aging, lifestyle, and other health-related problems [^2]. 

As the number of people experiencing memory-related problems increase, MemVault assists in the user's understanding of the contexts being referred to in conversation or in the actions they perform throughout the day through audible notifications prompted by their voices. The application/device detects confusion and/or forgetfulness before sending audible notifications.

## Solution
MemVault provides context reminders in real-time by using always-on recording, offline summarization, and audible notifications to help users understand references to different moments of their lives and/or the actions they are performing. 

## Features
- Always-on recording 
- Offline context summarization
- Audible notifications
